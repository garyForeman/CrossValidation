# CrossValidation
Cross Validation, a worked example demonstrating its use for determining a model's predictive power

This code is a supplement to Chapter 3 of my doctoral dissertation entitled *Mapping the Gamma-ray Distributions of the Magellanic Clouds*. While cross validation has long been used to constrain hyperparameters used in machine learning algorithms and even as a means to distinguish between algorithms themselves, the technique is not widely used in astronomy data analyses. Thus, I have deemed it appropriate to describe cross validation by way of example to motivate its use for my thesis project.
